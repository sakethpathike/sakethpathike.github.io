# Context

It's been more than a year since I started using openSUSE Tumbleweed. I used Ubuntu around 2019 (casually). I tried to
play a couple of games through Wine back then, it didn't work and later, it wouldn't even boot. Note that I didn't mess
with anything, it just randomly stopped working.

Around 2022 I used Fedora and I messed something up during some CLI stuff so bad I just broke it, and it didn't boot on
the next boot.
Again, back to Windows since it had everything I needed and I didn't really have a major reason to switch
to anything else.

As Windows started getting more annoying with basically everything they do (it only got worse since then hahahaha), I
decided to ditch it and thought of using a Linux distro instead.

Now, I didn't consider returning to Ubuntu and Fedora as I had a bad experience (Fedora would've been great too for me
at this point since I probably would've figured out what went wrong). So I did a lil research on what operating
systems don't suck and just work, and then I got to know about openSUSE. I didn't even know this chameleon's existence
until I came across a Reddit post, and then I chose Tumbleweed.

_This is a record of my experience (and thoughts) with Tumbleweed after using it for a year (and I have no plans to
migrate). It is based purely on what I need from an operating system and its ecosystem. So you won't see sections on
printers, Nvidia GPUs, or software I don't personally use. This is not a formal review by any means._

Now this time with Linux and an operating system in general, it was and still is a great experience. I usually use my
desktop for either programming some stuff, playing RDR2, or general browsing. These are the only reasons why I use my
desktop mostly and Tumbleweed nails everything, everything works as it's supposed to (in most cases). I messed up
the file system table once which I fixed myself with a lil research, so that's on me and isn't an issue with SUSE.

I didn't do any ricing yet since I need absolutely nothing on the screen except the software I'm working with. I have a
small panel on the bottom right which shows current date and time along with media player. This auto-hides if any window
is on the front, especially the full-screen ones. I have a shortcut to trigger it if I want to see the time.

I use activities in KDE a lot since switching between apps is much easier. I open different apps in different
activities, so instead of switching apps, I just switch activities. It is just more convenient because I can configure
shortcuts for these instead of going through all the apps to find what I am looking for.

It's fair to say that I got into the Linux environment, probably because of Tumbleweed.
Also, using CLI isn't my thing as in
most cases I use Android Studio or other IDEs, since that's the only main reason why I use my desktop besides gaming.
Although nothing changed in the tools I use but in the context of exploring or playing around with stuff, I've been
using CLI more than ever.

I've played RDR2 on both Windows and Tumbleweed. On Tumbleweed, gaming is excellent. I have spent more than 60 hours
in-game, and it works perfectly fine.

## Highs of Tumbleweed

openSUSE & Tumbleweed do great at:

### 1. Reliable

Tumbleweed goes through testing with openQA before the snapshots are available to the public. During this phase, bugs
and other issues can be caught and fixed accordingly. From the installation until now, it has never broken; it works as
it did on the first boot after installation. I had absolutely not a single problem in this context, I can't even nitpick
it. It works (in almost every case) and configures everything I would need and expect out of the box.

### 2. Preconfigured Snapper

This is one of the "peak cinema" moments of openSUSE. I tried to do some things, like switching to Hyprland from KDE and
messing with some stuff, but later thought I don't really need them. Now, I can just roll back to the state where these
things never existed in the system. It's as simple as:

\`\`\`
sudo snapper rollback <id>
\`\`\`

And within a couple of seconds, it's set, reboot and it will just work. If you broke it so bad that you can't even enter
into TTY, you can directly boot into these snapshots via boot menu (GRUB).

### 3. Great Community

While I never got a reason to ask anything myself, I've seen a couple of posts on the forum and Reddit where both users
and developers (specifically u/bmwiedemann) are chill and explain as normal humans would. Well, most of them.

### 4. OPI

Search for the entire OBS instance of openSUSE in CLI. That's dope stuff. I manually add repositories and install with
zypper itself, but this is definitely great if I don't want to go through the repos or find the software manually.

### 5. Chameleon

## Lows of Tumbleweed

I wouldn't say Tumbleweed is the perfect thing out there, it has a couple of lows, well, mostly nitpicks:

### 1. Audio Input Never Works

I don't know what's with this, it doesn't even detect my external microphone. I've gone through everything that I could
find on the internet. The same microphone worked completely fine on Windows, on Tumbleweed it just doesn't, so I had to
build a little app called [Otic](https://github.com/sakethpathike/Otic) which is a minimal Android app to stream
microphone input to the local network. I don't even care about this issue anymore since it doesn't really bother me, but
this exists (maybe only on my computer because I've seen this getting fixed for others).

### 2. Aggressive Firewall

This is definitely a nitpick. This might not be a _low_ for everyone, and I'm sure some people do prefer this by
default. \`firewall-cmd\` has been great for me to deal with this but allowing connections for certain ports manually is a
headache sometimes because I totally forget this is even a thing and go "oh guess what, now I have to allow the
connections on that port". The fact that the site used to say "The makers' choice for sysadmins, developers and desktop
users.", I guess that's fair.

### 3. Only Supports Open-Source Codecs Officially

Now, as someone who grew up using Windows and kept using it until I was around 19, I never thought I would need to
manually add codecs just to watch a video, since VLC comes pre-installed. I get that the official distribution strictly
allows only open-source stuff, which is definitely good, but I still kind of expect it to play the damn video by
default, and the same goes for exporting an edit from Kdenlive. Again, this is a nitpick.

Ironically, this can be easily fixed via OPI (which doesn't come pre-installed) or manually add the repository that has
codecs and pull it from that through zypper (that's exactly what OPI does behind the scenes for you).

---

The Installation phase is powerful but also a cockpit.
I don't even need to explain this, just see the installation setup,
it throws everything onto your face, but it is not overwhelming, so that's fine.

Also, zypper was never slow for me, at least I didn't feel it is slow. Now that is probably because Tumbleweed is the
only Linux-based distribution I've used as a regular operating system for a long time (basically my whole life till
date), so I'm not sure how others do at these metrics. It also got parallel downloads now.

YaST always gets into discussion when openSUSE is mentioned. I've never used the tools it offered except the
setup/installation itself, never got a reason to use it other than that.

# Conclusion

openSUSE Tumbleweed is an experience. A great one. Most reliable and stable yet. I can get started with my work or just
using it without thinking about a possible broken system after an update or on a regular boot or just after messing
around randomly. A solid rock that rolls.

---

While Tumbleweed has its lows, it's great at what it does. I wouldn't say Tumbleweed is necessarily underrated, but it
is definitely one of those under-marketed operating systems that is actually reliable, at least from the ones I've come
across.

openSUSE (or) SUSE should market openSUSE stuff more since it's not only an operating system but an entire ecosystem
powering Linux-based stuff. openQA, OBS, OPI, Snapper, a bunch of distributions for different use cases (and other
things that the openSUSE folks do) are cool and actually work.

Forget about marketing, they don't even mention these during the installation phase.
Not even OBS nor OPI (did I mention
that OPI isn't even pre-installed?), they just don't.
It's bad because these are actually useful.

### Would I recommend Tumbleweed if one wants a rolling release distro that is reliable?

Of course.

### Would I recommend it to newbies?

It depends. I was a newbie to the Linux desktop when I started using Tumbleweed. Practically, Tumbleweed is my first
Linux distro. Note that I didn't use both Fedora and Ubuntu even for 24 hours combined, and they were like _idk let's
see what this is about_. But you gotta do some work to get some things done, especially codecs.

And for software, you should not solely depend upon _Discover_. It's got quite a few official things, but a lot is
community-maintained. You shouldn't expect that contributors will always keep the 'Store' versions up to date. Most of
them do, but you still need to be willing to look around for yourself.

On openSUSE, OPI is your friend because it brings all of this directly to you instead of you having to go through
all those repos or sites manually.

If you aren't willing to Google a solution or just do some searches for learning, Tumbleweed (or any Linux-based
distribution) isn't for you. If this stuff isn't a problem, then of course, I would recommend Tumbleweed.

### Is it for everyone?

No.

### Is it perfect?

No.

### Does it get the work done?
