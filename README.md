This repo is entirely auto-generated from [kamp](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kamp)@9169ae475c4c11026f53d2b14baf365db403b91c.

- All HTML files are generated using [kapsule](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kapsule).
- Blog markdown files from the kamp repo are converted to HTML using a custom markdown parser combined with kapsule.
- The generated files on the master branch of this repo reflect exactly what kamp would serve @9169ae475c4c11026f53d2b14baf365db403b91c.
- This repo serves as a static snapshot mirror, pushed automatically by kamp-bot.

> Note: HTML files may include JavaScript similar to the live kamp app, so dynamic UI behavior is expected.
