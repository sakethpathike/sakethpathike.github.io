This repo is entirely auto-generated from [kamp](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kamp) @b0434cbb388b8968d36c17bd03031a747df76385.

- Blog markdown files from the kamp repo are converted to HTML using a custom markdown parser combined with [kapsule](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kapsule).
- The generated HTML reflects kampâ€™s content exactly at that commit.
- This repo serves as a static snapshot mirror, pushed automatically by kamp-bot.

> Note: The HTML includes JavaScript similar to the live kamp app, so dynamic UI behavior is expected.
