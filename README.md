- Blog markdown files from the kamp repo are converted to HTML using a custom markdown parser combined with kapsule.
- The generated files on the master branch of this repo reflect exactly what kamp would serve @a70319781351bb3afe42de2edab9c626c7cb460f.

> Note: HTML files may include JavaScript similar to the live kamp app, so dynamic UI behavior is expected.
