This repo is entirely auto-generated from [kamp](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kamp)@0e3d810fe5496d0aa8ab99a43e5b54ac3b421e5e.

- All HTML files are generated using [kapsule](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kapsule).
- Blog markdown files from the kamp repo are converted to HTML using a custom markdown parser combined with kapsule.
- The generated files on the master branch of this repo reflect exactly what kamp would serve @0e3d810fe5496d0aa8ab99a43e5b54ac3b421e5e.
- This repo serves as a static snapshot mirror, pushed automatically by kamp-bot.

> Note: HTML files may include JavaScript similar to the live kamp app, so dynamic UI behavior is expected.
